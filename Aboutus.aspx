					<p>INDUSTRY LEADING CUSTOM OPTIONS Today, customers are looking for the newest and most unique customization options to individualize their personal computer, and XOTIC PC has the answer. We offer more customization options and services than any other computer company on the market today. Everything from custom lighting and exclusive printed personalized graphics, to custom painting and airbrushing on site within our new facility. Click here to start your customization today! Computer games are loaded with incredible graphics, but the ultimate gaming experience requires the right equipment. When it comes to multiplayer, simulations, or first-person shooters, there’s no better way to feel like you’re in the middle of the action than with a custom built computer, laptop, or notebook to call your own. XOTIC PC specializes in designing and building notebooks, laptops, and desktop computers to suit any personal sense of style. Game consoles and handheld devices don’t stand a fair chance of competing with a tricked-out PC. If you are ready to design your own custom gaming computer, explore our inventory to find the perfect laptop or PC to get started. XOTIC PC offers full wrap customization options from edge to edge.
						<br> Our wrapping services allow you to add unique branding or texture to your laptop or computer at a fraction of the cost you might pay elsewhere. Our highly trained staff disassembles and carefully removes exterior hardware before transforming your stock chassis into something truly intimidating. Graphic wraps are made from a high-gloss, scratch-resistant vinyl sheet that forms to your notebook or desktop without any bubbles. What sets our custom wraps apart? We install and form wraps to the entire surface of your computer, not just the interior edge. We also welcome custom artwork at no additional cost. Interested in texture wrap modifications? We also offer carbon fiber and alligator exterior finishes to give your gaming computer a unique look. In addition to graphic, stealth, or textured wrapping, we also provide one-of-a-kind etching and painting services. All the custom gaming computers in our inventory allow you to select a personal laser-etch option. Our custom color options include Arctic White, Burnt Orange, Gecko Green, Gunmetal Grey, Plum Purple, Torch Red, Tuxedo Black, and so much more. Take your new computer to the next level by checking out our hydro-dipping services. Hydro-dipped graphics combine the best of paint and graphic wrapping, all sealed by water for durability and quality. We’ve come a long way since the height of the clone market, but enthusiasts are choosing custom gaming laptops, notebooks, and desktops more than ever. Enjoy a fully-loaded gaming experience on your own terms. Since 1999, XOTIC PC, Inc. has been an industry leader in personalized gaming computers. Simply put, we love what we do and there’s no better reward than helping our customers turn their visions into reality. We are constantly on the hunt for new materials, designs, and customization options. Do you have any innovative ideas or know of features that we don’t currently offer? Please contact us today.
